# The Plane Launching Project

This repository contains all the resources and code needed for our school’s plane-launching system, which propels a plane by spinning it around a central axis. The aim of the project is to make a practical impact on the aeronautical sector by simulating and optimising the mechanics and functionality of aircraft and other flying objects. Ultimately, the project seeks to contribute towards a greener, more sustainable future, while providing affordable solutions to support the growth and development of less economically developed regions.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organised into folders and subfolders, each with a specific purpose:

### 1. Logic

This folder contains all the core logic and code for the project.
- Simulation -> This subfolder contains the code for simulating the project, including trajectory calculations, graph plotting, and data analysis to determine the optimal conditions and features for the plane.
- Flight -> This subfolder holds all code related to the plane’s direct functionality, such as wing deployment, parabolic height detection, and stabilisation mechanisms (if within scope).

### 2. Docs

This folder provides detailed and user-friendly documentation for all the files in `/Logic`. It mirrors the structure of the `/Logic` folder and offers clear explanations of how and why the code works.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to design, simulate, and implement a functional plane-launching system. By using rotational mechanics, this project aims to:
1. Identify the optimal launch conditions (such as speed, angle, mass, etc.).
2. Simulate realistic flight trajectories, factoring in drag and other environmental influences.
3. Develop flight mechanisms, including stabilisation, wing deployment, and landing techniques.

## Applications

This project could make meaningful contributions in the following areas:
1. Aid for economically developing regions: The system could be highly effective in economically developing areas, particularly for delivering medical supplies, food, and other essential resources to remote locations.
2. Aerospace Engineering: This project provides insights into alternative propulsion methods and aerodynamics, with a focus on creating a cleaner and greener future in the aerospace industry.
